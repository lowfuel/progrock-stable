    "height" : 512, // resolution 
    "steps" : 50, // Number of steps to do
    "scale" : 7.0, // Affects how strongly the prompt is applied, a value from 6.0 to 9.0 is sensible.
    "seed" : "random", // Can be set to a specific number (no quotes), is incremented with each batch
    "frozen_seed" : false, // When true, the seed will be kept the same for every image (useful when randomizing prompts)

    "n_iter" : 1, // number of images to make within a batch (seed remains the same for each iteration)
    "variance" : 0.0, // Add a slight amount of extra random noise to create subtle variations (useful when combined with n_iter)

    // Go BIG stuff
    "gobig": false, // A true setting will trigger the gobig upscaling process (or, use --gobig on the command line)

    "gobig_scale": 2, // Scale factor to use for gobig (default is 2x width and height)
    "gobig_prescaled": false, // Used when gobig_init has already been upscaled by a third party tool
    "gobig_maximize": false, // auto-extend go_big into otherwise wasted space (do not use with gobig_prescaled)
    "gobig_overlap": 64, // number of pixels to blend against other areas in go_big
    "gobig_keep_slices": false, // optionally keep the individual slice images
    "esrgan_model": "realesrgan-x4plus", // the model to use for esrgan upscaling
    "augment_prompt": "zoomed in view of", // prepended to the prompt for gobig sections (set to null if no augment wanted)
    "gobig_cgs": null, // an alternate value to use for "scale" above, used for the individual sections of a gobig render
    // Generally, you can ignore most of the rest of this
    "method" : "k_lms", // sampling method to use. Options: "k_lms", "k_dpm_2_ancestral", "k_dpm_2", "k_heun", "k_euler_ancestral", "k_euler", "ddim"

    "cool_down": 0.0, // number of seconds to pause between images, to keep GPU cool
    "checkpoint": "./models/sd.ckpt",
    "use_jpg": false, // set this to save your output in JPG format to save space
    "hide_metadata": false, // set to true if you don"t want your prompt and seed in the PNG output metadata
    "save_settings": false, // set to true if you want a settings file like this saved with every image
    "improve_composition": false, // improve images larger than 512x512 by first rendering at 512x512 and then using that result as an init
    "gpu_id_filenames": false // put the GPU ID in output filenames to avoid overwriting (for multiple GPU setups)
}
// dynamic values:
// prompt can contain words or phrases that will be randomly selected, like so:
// "a <dog|cat|person> walking on the <beach|rooftop|path>"
//
// You can also randomly select certain other values in the same way.
// Currently steps, scale, and eta are supported. Make sure you put your selections in quotes!
// (I'm supporting eta here despite the fact that it does not seem to have any impact on output)
// Example:
// "steps": "<50|75|100|125>"
//
// Unique to prompts, you can also get more than one of the selections back.
// In this example, two of the selections are used:
// "a <^^2|lovely|unique|strong|miserable|wild> person perusing ArtDiffuser's instagram."
// might return "a lovely wild person perusing ArtDiffuser's instagram."
